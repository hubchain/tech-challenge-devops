# Hubchain DevOps Tech Challenge

Hey DevOps guy. Welcome. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to carve out 16 hours and deploy an application to a remote server hosted at a public cloud provider.

> **Hey this is important!**
> We hope you can spend about 8 hours on this project. If you can finish faster -- great! If not, limit yourself and don't spend much longer than 16 hours MAX.

Our clients must exchange files with our developers, and because GDPR we must take some actions to prevent data exposure. We decided to use OwnCloud to allow remote file sharing. As a DevOps you should deploy OwnCloud to a cloud environment.

## Requirements for a valid solution
- Readme explaining how to run the project
- You can write your scripts or use a configuration management tool, like Ansible
- It must use HTTPS
- It must be deployed in a Linux host
- It should be hosted in a public cloud provider

## Nice to have
- SDN
- Managed Firewall
- Distributed Application
- One command to deploy all
- Anything else you would like to add...

## when you are finished
- Please send your solution as a github repository link to [tech.challenge@hubchain.com](tech.challenge@hubchain.com). Do not forget to send us the application link
- also please don't fork this repo as other candidates could then start build on top of your solution ;-)
